Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. \nConsideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.\nMoreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.\nIn conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important. Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality. However, people might not get what they want all the time. The sky is the limit; there are all kinds of personality out there. We need to be flexible to be account into society.",

This helps to maintain a clean and comfortable living space, and also reduces financial stress.\n\nLastly, effective communication is essential for a positive roommate experience. This means being open and honest about one's needs, concerns, and expectations. For example, if a roommate is having a noisy gathering, they should inform their roommates in advance and come to a mutually agreeable solution. Good communication can prevent misunderstandings and conflicts, and help roommates to find common ground and resolve issues amicably.\n\nIn conclusion, a good roommate should possess qualities such as respect, responsibility, and effective communication. These traits are essential for creating a positive and supportive living environment, which is conducive to academic success and personal well-being.

                "text": "The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.\nFirst of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.\nThe popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.\nIn conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.",

However, this revolution has also led to concerns regarding the degradation of written language. While it is true that these forms of communication can pose challenges to traditional linguistic norms, the argument that they seriously threaten the status of written language merits a more nuanced examination.\n\nOn one hand, the brevity and informality characterizing text messaging and emails have given rise to a plethora of abbreviations, acronyms, and emoticons. This shift has fundamentally altered how people use language, often promoting a more casual style that may undermine grammatical conventions and spelling precision. For instance, the ease of texting has led many to develop a reliance on shorthand expressions, which may erode literacy skills among younger generations who are still mastering traditional writing.\n\nConversely, it can be argued that these modern communication methods serve as a creative outlet for language evolution rather than a threat. The rich array of forms emerging from texting and emailing, such as memes, GIFs, and visual storytelling, reflects a dynamic linguistic landscape. Furthermore, the instant nature of these communications encourages immediacy and spontaneity, allowing for real-time engagement that traditional written language often lacks.\n\nIn many respects, the relationship between technology and language is symbiotic; email and text may have changed the context in which written communication occurs, but they have also revitalized interest in language through their innovative formats. Importantly, many people still engage in formal and high-standard writing when necessary, indicating that written language has not been wholly compromised.\n\nIn conclusion, while the rise of email and text messaging has brought challenges to traditional writing standards, it has also introduced opportunities for language evolution and diversity. Thus, rather than viewing these technologies as a significant threat, we should recognize their capacity to enrich and adapt the way we communicate.",

                "text": "Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.\nTo begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.\nNevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.\nBy way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.",

I contend that zoos do hold significant value, both for education and species conservation.\n\nFirst and foremost, modern zoos play a critical role in educating the public about wildlife and the environment. Through carefully designed exhibits, zoos provide visitors with the opportunity to observe animals in ways that might not be possible otherwise. For example, children can learn about biodiversity, ecosystems, and the importance of conservation efforts through interactive programs and guided tours. By fostering awareness and appreciation for wildlife, zoos inspire future generations to engage in environmental stewardship and support conservation initiatives.\n\nMoreover, zoos contribute to the preservation of endangered species. Many zoos participate in breeding programs that aim to increase the population of species at risk of extinction. The success of such programs can be demonstrated by the recovery of species like the California condor and the Arabian oryx, which have been reintroduced into the wild after significant efforts in captivity. Without zoos, these species would likely face a grim fate, driven to extinction by habitat loss and poaching.\n\nCritics often argue that confining animals in enclosed spaces is inhumane. However, many modern zoos prioritize animal welfare, providing environments that mimic their natural habitats and allowing them to exhibit natural behaviors. Progressive zoos are committed to research that informs their care for animals and generates data beneficial for wildlife conservation globally.\n\nIn conclusion, zoos are far from purposeless. They serve as vital institutions for education and species conservation. By fostering an appreciation for nature and playing a significant role in protecting endangered wildlife, zoos contribute positively to society and the planet as a whole.",

Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.\nSome people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.\nOn the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.\nThere are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes. It would mean another industrial revolution.\nTo put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.",

This has sparked a debate about the best approach to mitigate environmental issues: whether to adopt a simpler way of life or to innovate further using technology.\n\nProponents of a simpler lifestyle argue that modern conveniences have led to increased consumption of resources and heightened pollution. They maintain that by embracing simplicity, individuals can reduce their carbon footprint. Advocates suggest actions such as reducing waste, relying on local produce, and minimizing energy usage. This perspective emphasizes a return to nature and traditional practices, which can foster a more sustainable relationship with the environment. They argue that less reliance on technology can lead to lower emissions and conservation of resources.\n\nOn the other hand, many believe that technology itself holds the key to solving environmental problems. Innovations such as renewable energy sources, electric vehicles, and sustainable agricultural practices demonstrate potential solutions to reduce our environmental impact. These technological advancements can help us optimize resource usage and create cleaner alternatives to traditional systems. Moreover, advancements in recycling technologies and carbon capture can help address and reverse some of the damage already incurred.\n\nIn my opinion, a balanced approach is essential. While simplifying our lifestyles can greatly contribute to environmental sustainability, technology also has an indispensable role in addressing the urgent environmental crises we face. Implementing greener technologies while also promoting conscious consumption can create a synergistic effect that maximizes our efforts to safeguard the planet. Ultimately, it is not a matter of choosing one path over the other but rather integrating both strategies to foster a sustainable future.

While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people, I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us.\nAdmittedly, job can bring us happiness. People can receive a sense of values and respected from job. If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence. In addition, job can provide money to us. \nHowever, people should concern more about their living environment than job. First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives. Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years. For example, Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day. These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work. \nSecond, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people. Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety. Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly. Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil. In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests. In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people. Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases.\nIn conclusion, it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers.",

While some argue that the living environment plays a significant role in determining happiness, I firmly believe that one's job has a more profound impact on their happiness. \n\nFirst and foremost, a person's job is a significant part of their daily life, often occupying a substantial amount of their time and energy. A fulfilling and engaging job can bring a sense of purpose and satisfaction, which are essential components of happiness. On the other hand, a dull or stressful job can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction, ultimately affecting one's overall well-being. \n\nIn contrast, while the living environment can certainly influence one's mood and quality of life, its impact may be less direct and consistent compared to the daily experience of a job. For instance, a person may live in a beautiful and comfortable house, but if they are miserable in their job, their overall happiness will still be compromised. Furthermore, a good job can provide the financial means to improve one's living environment, thereby creating a positive feedback loop that enhances happiness.\n\nAdditionally, research has shown that people tend to adapt to their living environment over time, a phenomenon known as hedonic adaptation. This means that the initial happiness boost from moving to a new and exciting place often wears off, leaving individuals seeking other sources of fulfillment, such as their job. \n\nIn conclusion, while both job and living environment are important factors that contribute to an individual's happiness, I believe that one's job has a more significant effect. A fulfilling job can provide a sense of purpose, financial security, and personal growth, all of which are crucial for achieving happiness. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize job satisfaction and engagement in pursuit of a happy and fulfilling life.",

Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.\nEveryone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.\nIn addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.\nLast but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. \nOn the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time. Additionally, honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can't be missing for a persuasive expression.",

While some individuals prefer the asynchronous methods of email and voice mail, others favor the immediacy of telephone or face-to-face interactions. As for me, I prefer face-to-face communication over other methods.\n\nFace-to-face communication allows for a depth of interaction that other methods cannot match. It enables the exchange of not just verbal information, but also non-verbal cues such as body language and facial expressions. These non-verbal signals are crucial for conveying emotions, as they provide context and help prevent misunderstandings that can easily arise from text-based or voice-only communication. Furthermore, face-to-face interactions facilitate immediate feedback and clarification, making conversations more efficient and personal.\n\nIn contrast, while email and voice mail offer the convenience of asynchronous communication, allowing parties to respond at their leisure, they lack the immediacy and personal touch of face-to-face interactions. Telephone conversations, though immediate, still miss out on the non-verbal cues that are present in face-to-face communication, making them less personal and engaging compared to in-person discussions.\n\nMoreover, face-to-face communication fosters stronger, more meaningful relationships. The personal connection established through seeing and directly interacting with someone contributes significantly to building trust and understanding. In both personal and professional settings, the ability to read non-verbal cues and engage immediately with others can make a significant difference in the outcome of interactions, from sealing business deals to resolving conflicts.\n\nIn conclusion, while different methods of communication have their advantages, face-to-face interaction stands out for its unique ability to combine verbal and non-verbal cues, immediacy, and personal connection. For those who value deep, meaningful, and efficient communication, face-to-face interaction is the preferred method.",

                "text": "Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.\nFirstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.\nIn addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.\nFinally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.\nIn conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.",

However, this advancement is accompanied by significant challenges that cannot be overlooked. In my opinion, while automobiles have improved aspects of our lives, the problems they have created warrant serious consideration.\n\nFirstly, the convenience afforded by automobiles has revolutionized how we travel and conduct daily activities. With the ability to drive from one location to another in a matter of minutes, individuals can access job opportunities, educational institutions, and recreational facilities that were once out of reach. This increased mobility fosters economic growth, as people can commute further distances for work, expanding labor markets and enhancing productivity.\n\nNevertheless, the rise of automobiles is not without its drawbacks. The environmental impact is one of the most pressing issues. Cars are significant contributors to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate change and posing health risks to urban populations. Reports have shown that cities with heavy traffic often experience detrimental levels of air quality, leading to respiratory issues among residents.\n\nFurthermore, road safety remains a serious concern. The surge in automobile usage correlates with an increase in traffic accidents, which claim countless lives each year. Despite advancements in vehicle safety technology, human error, reckless driving, and distracted driving continue to pose significant risks on the roads.\n\nIn conclusion, while automobiles have undeniably enhanced modern life by providing unprecedented mobility and economic opportunities, they have also introduced critical challenges, including environmental degradation and safety concerns. A balanced approach is necessary\u2014fostering innovation in sustainable transportation methods, such as electric vehicles and public transit systems, can help mitigate these issues while retaining the benefits that automobiles bring to society.",

Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching. However, according to my experiences, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research.\nFirst of all, doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors. Universities are relatively fenced environment. The research projects provide communication with the outside. In addition, by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies. I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college. He was often invited to do speech in other universities. Although my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects. The research projects like windows opened to the wider world.\nSecondly, professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities. It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus. Also, you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together. Consequently, there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages. We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin. Universities positively contribute the professors' success. \nLast but not least, doing research could also improve the teaching quality. With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom. They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice. I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project. By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments. The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching. \nFor those reasons, it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research. While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society.",

While the necessity for cutting-edge research in academia is undeniable, I believe that university professors should prioritize educating students. A balanced approach is essential, but ensuring that students receive quality education must take precedence for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, the primary mission of educational institutions is to foster learning. Students attend universities not only to gain knowledge in their field but also to develop critical thinking and analytical skills. Professors play a fundamental role in this process, influencing students\u2019 intellectual growth and preparing them for future careers. If professors allocate excessive time to research at the expense of teaching, the quality of education may suffer, leading to a disconnect between academic theory and its practical application.\n\nMoreover, the educational experience is not solely about content delivery; it involves mentorship and personal interaction. Professors who are more engaged in teaching can better connect with their students, provide meaningful guidance, and inspire them to pursue their interests. Such relationships can significantly enhance student motivation and performance, creating a more enriching academic environment.\n\nOn the other hand, research is essential for driving innovation and contributing to a field's body of knowledge. However, when professors prioritize research over teaching, they may inadvertently neglect their responsibility to shape the next generation of thinkers and leaders. Universities should view teaching and research as complementary rather than mutually exclusive; nevertheless, teaching should be viewed as the foundation upon which effective research is built.\n\nIn conclusion, while research is vital to the progression of knowledge, the sacred trust of education remains the paramount duty of university professors. By investing more time in teaching, professors can create a profound impact on their students, equipping them with the skills necessary to thrive in a rapidly changing world.",

                "text": "Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots. The problem off traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused interest of many city planners. It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock. However, I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way.\nFirst of all, public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street. Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options. Apparently, a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number. Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles. Together, they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays.\nSecond, rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas. It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now. As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities. The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people.\nIn conclusion, city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas. It is highly recommended to put forward such solution, especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China, with the ever-growing demand for job or education.",

While I agree that reducing travel demand can mitigate traffic, I believe it is not the sole solution. A multifaceted approach is necessary to effectively tackle the issue.\n\nFirstly, the rise of remote work is a significant step towards diminishing traffic congestion. The COVID-19 pandemic has led many businesses to adopt flexible work arrangements, reducing the number of commuters during peak hours. By promoting telecommuting, cities can lessen the strain on their transportation infrastructure, as fewer people on the roads equate to decreased traffic congestion.\n\nAdditionally, online education and e-commerce have transformed traditional frameworks, allowing individuals to access learning opportunities and shop without the need to travel. Schools and universities offering hybrid or fully online courses can significantly decrease the volume of daily commutes. Similarly, encouraging local shopping through enhanced e-commerce options can ease congestion by reducing the need for residents to travel long distances for goods.\n\nHowever, while reducing travel needs may help, it is insufficient on its own. Cities must also improve public transportation systems, making them more efficient, reliable, and user-friendly. Investing in alternative modes of transport, such as cycling and walking infrastructure, can promote more sustainable commuting options. Urban planning that incorporates mixed-use developments can also encourage local living, thus minimizing the distance people need to travel for work or leisure.\n\nIn conclusion, while I agree that reducing the need for travel is a crucial strategy in combating urban traffic congestion, it should be complemented by enhancements in public transportation, urban design, and alternative commuting solutions. A holistic approach is essential for creating sustainable and livable cities.",

Therefore, whilst this essay will address the elements of competition and predation that create the primary issues of conflict, including; overlapping of land resources and water resources, animals foraging, mobility and economic development pressures like tourism and road development. I will mainly target and discuss the symbolic representations that may be attached to human - wildlife conflicts and conclude by addressing the future of human - wildlife conflicts. There does appear to be a considerably higher number of reports on people- wildlife conflicts within the tropical regions of the world. However, it is not a phenomenon restricted to the tropics. Conflicts between humans and wildlife are universal. Conflicts occurring in the tropics are topical because the developments are recent, in comparison to those countries in the northern hemisphere, where wild predators and livestock were hunted to extinction during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Therefore, although I do provide several anthropological studies conducted in tropical regions, I have also included examples of studies recorded in Europe. Conflicts arise from competition, this can take the form of 'horizontal' competition i.e. between two species that share the same trophic level, or 'vertical' predation, which occurs between species at different trophic levels. When these relations overlap 'garden hunting' occurs, this usually entails wildlife being killed when they come to feed on crops etc and this feeding pattern is used as a kind of hunting bait. This occurrence is evident within the elitist sport of fox hunting practiced in Britain.",

This conflict arises when the needs and habits of humans and wildlife compete for the same space and resources, such as food, water, and shelter. The consequences of human-wildlife conflict can be devastating, including crop damage, loss of livestock, and even human injury or death.\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict is not a phenomenon limited to tropical regions of the world. While it is true that many tropical regions, such as Africa and Asia, experience high levels of human-wildlife conflict due to the abundance of wildlife and growing human populations, it is a global issue that affects many parts of the world. For example, in North America, human-wildlife conflict occurs between humans and animals such as bears, wolves, and deer, particularly in areas where urbanization and agriculture encroach on natural habitats. In Europe, conflicts arise between humans and species like wolves, wild boar, and birds, especially in areas where farming and conservation interests clash.\n\nExamples of human-wildlife conflict include the elephant-human conflict in Sri Lanka, where elephants raid crops and damage property, leading to retaliation against the elephants by farmers. Another example is the wolf-livestock conflict in the western United States, where wolves prey on sheep and cattle, resulting in the killing of wolves by ranchers. In Australia, the conflict between humans and kangaroos is significant, particularly in agricultural areas where kangaroos are seen as pests that compete with livestock for food.\n\nIn conclusion, human-wildlife conflict is a widespread issue that affects many regions of the world, not just the tropics. It is crucial to address this issue through sustainable land-use planning, wildlife management, and education to mitigate the negative impacts on both humans and wildlife.

Therefore to demonstrate that sugar brought about a social revolution in addition to an agricultural revolution, this essay will focus on the islands of Jamaica and Barbados from around the years 1630 to 1690. This is because by 1700, both Jamaica and Barbados became significant producers of sugar. Moreover, the English had found few traces of precious metals in the parts of America which they initially colonized. This meant that the islands (or inland settlements) that they did set up tended to be far more focused around agricultural activities. By the mid 1600s England was in possession of both Jamaica and Barbados. As a result, sugar would become the defining feature of the islands; shaping their future and acting as a precedent for the development of other Caribbean islands in later years. In order to show that society and agriculture in the Caribbean experienced change after the introduction of sugar into its economy, it is useful to make a brief summary of the condition of both areas before continuing. Jamaica was originally a Spanish colony before the English seized it in 1655 and gained formal possession in 1670 through the Treaty of Madrid. Barbados was initially settled in 1627 by the English so remained a British colony until its independence. Spain didn't truly realize the potential economic wealth that could be generated from producing and harvesting the sugar cane in large quantities until after silver and gold mines began to dry up in South America. By then the Spanish had lost some of their territories in the Caribbean to other powers vying for control in the area. In Cuba, sugar became the predominant force in the economy only by in the late 16 th century.",

Sugar cultivation transformed the economic landscape and fundamentally altered societal structures, influencing everything from labor dynamics to social hierarchies.\n\nAgriculturally, sugar became the backbone of Caribbean economies. The crop thrived in the tropical climate and rich soil of the islands, leading to the establishment of vast sugar plantations. These plantations required substantial labor forces, which initially consisted of indigenous peoples. However, as the indigenous population declined due to disease and brutal colonial practices, European colonists turned to African slaves to meet their labor demands. This shift not only intensified the transatlantic slave trade but also established the Caribbean\u2019s reliance on slave labor for agricultural production, contributing to a brutal system of exploitation that would shape the region's socio-economic structure.\n\nSocially, the sugar economy created new hierarchies and social classes. A wealthy planter class emerged, controlling land and resources, while a marginalized population of enslaved Africans formed the backbone of the labor force. This stark division created a society marked by racial and economic disparities, with planters wielding significant political power. The impact on African communities was profound; cultural, social, and familial structures were disrupted, leading to the development of new cultural identities within the enslaved populations.\n\nMoreover, the advent of sugar transformed the Caribbean's demographic makeup and promoted the establishment of European colonial societies. Towns and cities grew around the sugar industry, becoming melting pots of various cultures, which would eventually influence Caribbean identity.\n\nIn conclusion, sugar not only revolutionized agriculture in the Caribbean but also precipitated profound social changes, laying the groundwork for modern Caribbean societies.

The existence of massive difference in the standard of living all over the world made economists to find the causation of lower living standard in poor countries and the possible ways of helping them to grow faster and catch up with rich ones. The neoclassical theory of economic growth was developed in 1956 by Robert M. Solow, hence, also known as the Solow growth model. It presents the Harrod-Domar model, but adding labour as a factor of production. Solow argued that a key determinant of people's standard of living is how much a nation saves and invests. However, capital accumulation alone cannot explain the persistent growth in living standards. The model assigns continues long-run growth to technological progress, but leaves unexplained the economic determinant of that technological progress. It is simply assumed. Saving, technological progress and growth of population affect the level of output and growth of an economy over time. The basic model assumes that there is no technological progress and that the labour force is fixed: Y = F (K, L), where Y is output, K is capital and L is labour force. The real economy, however, experiences both population growth and technological progress. Express the function in per capita terms: Y/L = F (K/L, 1), the new production function will finally take form of: y = f (k), where output and capital are measured in per head terms (Fig.1). The slope of this function equals the Marginal Product of Capital (MPK) which shows how much extra output a worker produces when given an extra unit of capital.

In contrast, the Endogenous growth model suggests that economic growth is driven by internal factors such as investments in human capital, research and development, and innovation.\n\nThe theoretical differences between the two models have significant implications for the distribution of income levels across the world. The Solow model implies that economic growth is largely determined by factors outside the control of individual economies, leading to a more pessimistic view of income convergence across countries. On the other hand, the Endogenous growth model suggests that economies have the ability to influence their own growth trajectories through investments in human capital and innovation, leading to a more optimistic view of income convergence.\n\nIn terms of applicability, the Solow model may be more relevant for developing economies with limited access to technology and institutional constraints. In such cases, external factors such as foreign aid and technological transfers may play a significant role in driving economic growth. On the other hand, the Endogenous growth model may be more applicable to advanced economies with strong institutions and high levels of human capital, where investments in research and development can drive innovation and economic growth. Furthermore, the Endogenous growth model may be more relevant in scenarios where governments have the ability to implement policies that promote human capital formation and innovation, such as through investments in education and research and development subsidies. Overall, understanding the differences between the Solow and Endogenous growth models can provide valuable insights into the drivers of economic growth and the distribution of income levels across the world.",

                "text": "The post-war era signified a need for fundamental change. Not only was the global economy in tatters, but international relations were incredibly strained. The Bretton Woods system of international institutions; the IMF, World Bank and GATT, contextualised against a fixed exchange rate sought to rebuild the international political economy. Signed and ratified during the first three weeks of July 1944, The agreement committed member states to peg their currencies, via the exchange rate mechanism, to the dollar which was fixed to the value of Gold, held constant at 35$ per ounce. Members were committed to maintain par values within a 1% margin of the fixed rate, aided by the IMF, initially set up to bridge any temporary payments imbalances. (Grabbe, O. 1996) Despite the intentions and aims of the Bretton Woods system to create a stable global economic environment, the system collapsed within a quarter of a century of its inception. Discussed throughout political economy literature are the possible contributive causes of the breakdown. Whether the demise of the system is perceived as a consequence of inherent structural weakness; as embodied in the functional ineffectiveness of the founding institutions, or operational dysfunction; characterised by the unanticipated emergent asymmetrical arrangement which embodied extensive periods of deficit, uncertainty and speculation, not only shapes our perceptions of the inevitability of the failure, but also our interpretation of the role this tumultuous period has played in the formation of the contemporary global economic structure as we know it. By firstly investigating the interlinked web of contributive causes of the Bretton Woods breakdown, before discussing the various ways in which events post 1971, have been shaped by the consequences of the preceding era, this essay aims to address both the inevitability of the breakdown and the long term consequences of such a development.",

                "text": "The collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971 was a pivotal event in international economic history. Established in 1944, the system was designed to promote global economic stability and cooperation through fixed exchange rates and a gold-pegged US dollar. However, the collapse of this system was, in retrospect, inevitable.\n\nOne major factor contributing to its demise was the growing imbalance in global trade. The United States, which had been the dominant economic power after World War II, began to experience significant trade deficits. This, coupled with the increasing cost of the Vietnam War, put pressure on the US dollar, making it difficult to maintain the fixed exchange rate. Furthermore, the emergence of other economic powers, such as Germany and Japan, challenged the US's economic dominance, further straining the system.\n\nThe long-run consequences of the collapse of the Bretton Woods system have been profound. The shift to a floating exchange rate regime allowed currencies to fluctuate in value, leading to increased volatility in international markets. This has made it challenging for countries to maintain economic stability, particularly for developing nations with limited foreign exchange reserves. On the other hand, the collapse of Bretton Woods paved the way for the development of modern international financial markets, facilitating the free flow of capital across borders and promoting globalization.\n\nIn conclusion, the collapse of the Bretton Woods system was inevitable due to the inherent flaws in its design and the shifting global economic landscape. The consequences of its collapse have been far-reaching, with both positive and negative impacts on the global economy. While it has led to increased economic volatility, it has also facilitated the growth of international trade and finance, shaping the modern global economic order.",

                "text": "When acquiring language children are taught to read and write but seemingly pick up language and learn to speak without any formal instruction. There are many ways in which it can be shown that children aren't taught language whereas they are reading and writing. Children are supplied with both informal and formal tuition in the reading and writing systems. By the time children reach school age they are likely to have received some form of informal teaching of reading and writing from parents which as Crystal notes, is often in the form of a colourful alphabet book bought for the child by relatives. Whatever the source though, the point is; even by the time the child reaches school age they have received some form of teaching regarding reading and writing. At school this obviously increases to formal teaching and schools are legally required to teach children reading and writing. There can be no doubt therefore that children are taught to read and write - it is a simple fact. We can now turn to look then at whether children are taught to speak. The answer is no, at least not in any formal way. By the time children start to attend school they are expected to be able to speak showing that children have learnt to speak without formal teaching. It has been argued that children learn to speak through imitating adults, which could be considered a form of indirect teaching. However the existence of virtuous errors where children produce utterances they couldn't have heard have disproved this idea. Chomsky's idea of innateness and that children have a Language Acquisition Device and are as such are \"genetically 'prewired' to acquire language\" lends credence to the idea that children aren't taught language but instead acquire it naturally. One example that also helps support the idea is that of the silent kids of Nicaragua.",

                "text": "Children's development of reading and writing skills is a complex process that stands in contrast to the relatively innate ability to acquire spoken language. While most children learn to speak and understand their native language naturally through social interaction and exposure, reading and writing require explicit instruction and practice. This distinction highlights the unique demands of literacy and the need for structured educational systems.\n\nSpeech acquisition occurs naturally as children interact with family and peers. From babbling as infants to forming complete sentences, this process unfolds through observation and imitation. Children absorb phonetics intuitively, adapting their speech as they communicate. In contrast, reading and writing are not instinctive but must be taught through specific methodologies. These skills necessitate an understanding of symbols, sounds, and grammatical structure, which cannot be acquired through mere exposure.\n\nThe process of learning to read involves decoding written language, associating letters with sounds, and understanding the meaning behind words. Similarly, writing requires children to translate their thoughts into written form, adhering to conventions of spelling, punctuation, and syntax. These skills are cumulative, building from simple tasks like recognizing letters to complex activities such as composing essays or narratives.\n\nMoreover, differences in learning environments greatly affect literacy development. While children can practice speaking freely at home and in social settings, reading and writing are often confined to educational contexts where structured lessons and targeted feedback shape their abilities. This can lead to disparities in literacy among children, influenced by access to resources, teaching methods, and parental involvement.\n\nIn conclusion, while speech is a natural evolution of communication, reading and writing are acquired skills that demand deliberate learning. This fundamental difference underscores the importance of quality education in fostering literacy, equipping children with essential tools for lifelong learning and effective expression.",

        "question": "Should we be worried about the effects on children of aggressive images on film and television?",
        "answers": [
            {
                "text": "Figures have shown that the amount of time children spend watching television has increased (Hamilton, 1998; Brown and Cantor, 2000; Bushman and Anderson, 2001). Children are considered inhabitants of a world inundated by mass media (Brown and Witherspoon, 2002). A controversial issue is when the content of the viewed material contains violence and aggression. The frequency of this content in television programmes and in films was quantified concisely by Browne and Hamilton-Giachritsis (2005). Results from the UNESCO Global Television Violence study show that 61% of programmes investigated contained violence, 55% of which portrayed violence in a realistic setting. They also report that in 71% of these instances, characters showed no remorse for their actions and received no criticism for them. 42% of aggressive acts reported were associated with humour. Over 1000 violent murders, rapes and assaults are shown on television each year (Brown and Witherspoon, 2002). These statistics are worrisome when viewed in light of two theoretical approaches. The first is Bandura's social learning theory, which has given impetus to the television violence debate. Bandura hypothesised that behaviour can be learned through observation, particularly when the behaviour is aggressive. He believed the child's attention to be specifically captured by the violent act, leading them to retain it for the future and to conclude that this aggressive behaviour is acceptable, based largely on whether or not the character is punished. (Bandura, 1973). Viewed in this light, the statistic that characters receive no criticism for their actions 71% of the time becomes dangerous. The concept of learning aggression by observation holds important and worrying implications for this debate, as it suggests that children have the potential to imitate anything they see on television. The second theory is the principle of operant conditioning first investigated by Thorndike (1911). Operant conditioning suggests that positive and negative reinforcements following behaviour will accordingly increase or diminish the chance of a behaviour being performed again.",

                "text": "The portrayal of aggressive images on film and television has sparked a heated debate about its potential impact on children. In today's media-saturated world, it is inevitable that children will be exposed to violent and aggressive content. The question is, should we be worried about the effects of such exposure on children?\n\nResearch suggests that exposure to aggressive images can have a profound impact on children's behavior, attitudes, and emotional well-being. Children who are repeatedly exposed to violent media are more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior, desensitize to violence, and develop a distorted view of reality. Furthermore, aggressive images can also lead to increased fear, anxiety, and decreased empathy in children.\n\nMoreover, children's brains are still developing, and exposure to aggressive images can shape their perceptions and attitudes towards violence. This can lead to a normalization of aggressive behavior, making it more acceptable and even desirable. Additionally, children may learn aggressive behaviors and attitudes from observing them on screen, which can be reinforced by repeated exposure.\n\nTherefore, it is essential that parents, caregivers, and media regulators take steps to protect children from the harmful effects of aggressive images. This can be achieved by implementing age restrictions, monitoring children's media consumption, and promoting media literacy. Moreover, the media industry itself should take responsibility for producing content that is suitable for children and promotes positive values and behaviors.\n\nIn conclusion, yes, we should be worried about the effects of aggressive images on children. The potential harm caused by exposure to violent and aggressive media is a serious concern that requires attention and action from parents, media regulators, and the media industry. By working together, we can create a safer and more positive media environment for children to grow and develop.",

                "text": "The nature of human reasoning is a popular area of research in psychology. Its popularity has derived from questions about the rationality of human thought. Rational thought is sometimes defined as thought which is analogous to the laws of logic, where there is always a correct or incorrect answer to a problem and a finite approach to solving it (Eysenck & Keane, 2000). Many psychologists would disagree with this definition because they believe that reasoning does not have to be logical to be rational (Sloman, 1996, Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996 and Chater, Oaksford, Nakisa & Redington, 2003). Sloman (1996) focused, in depth, on the debate over rationality in human reasoning, and created a model involving two systems of reasoning to explain the variety of results found in experiments that investigated reasoning. The two systems of reasoning proposed by Sloman (1996) are an associative system and a rule-based system. These two systems differ in their computations and, when one system is favoured over the other, the way a problem is approached. In the associative system, reasoning takes the form of detecting similarities between situations and events. Associations formed in the past can be drawn upon to solve a particular problem. The associative system does not involve the use of logic but does involve the use of general rules that a person has derived from experience. In the rule-based system, the rules are more specific and have a logical structure. Rules in the rule-based system can be represented in the form of symbols and problems are solved by direct application of these rules. To illustrate the difference between the two systems, Sloman (1996) uses the example of working out the amount of change to give to a customer in a shop.",

                "text": "The question of whether there are two systems of reasoning has been a topic of debate among cognitive psychologists. According to Sloman (1996), our minds are equipped with two distinct systems of reasoning: an associative system and a rule-based system. The associative system is responsible for automatic, intuitive, and rapid processing, whereas the rule-based system is responsible for controlled, conscious, and effortful processing. \n\nStanovich and West (2000) also propose a dual-system theory, where they refer to these two systems as System 1 and System 2. System 1 is characterized by its automatic and effortless nature, often relying on mental shortcuts and heuristics. On the other hand, System 2 is a more controlled and deliberate system, which requires cognitive effort and is responsible for logical and analytical thinking.\n\nThe distinction between these two systems is crucial, as it can help explain why people often make irrational decisions or fail to respond logically to certain situations. For instance, when we are under time pressure or distracted, we may rely more heavily on System 1, leading to errors in reasoning. Conversely, when we have the time and motivation to engage in deliberate thinking, we can override the automatic responses of System 1 with the more controlled processing of System 2.\n\nThe existence of two systems of reasoning has significant implications for our understanding of human cognition and decision-making. By recognizing the interplay between these two systems, we can better appreciate the complexities of human thought and develop strategies to improve our critical thinking abilities. In conclusion, the theories of Sloman and Stanovich and West provide compelling evidence for the existence of two systems of reasoning, highlighting the importance of considering both automatic and controlled processing in our understanding of human cognition.",
