Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. \nConsideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.\nMoreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.\nIn conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important. Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality. However, people might not get what they want all the time. The sky is the limit; there are all kinds of personality out there. We need to be flexible to be account into society.",

With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.\nFirst of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.\nThe popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts.

With this development, some people believe that they may be factors contributing to the decline of written language. I concur with this idea due to their advantages and the evident impact we can observe today regarding the use of these new means of communication.\n\nFirstly, it is easy to identify numerous benefits that users can derive from email and text messaging, which explains their immense popularity. Prior to the advent of email and mobile phones, human beings communicated through face-to-face meetings, sending letters, or making calls from home phones. These traditional methods often posed challenges due to their expensiveness, difficulties in long-distance communication or emergency situations, and the risk of information loss. However, email and cell phones have alleviated these obstacles. People can send or receive electronic messages anywhere and at any time they desire. Specifically, thanks to the functionality provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer large amounts of information, even to multiple individuals simultaneously. They are so convenient that the majority of the population prefer to use them over traditional methods.\n\nThe popularity of email and text messaging, as a consequence, leads to the erosion of written language's position.

            {
                "text": "For a long time, the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals. However, other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing. In my opinion, the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons.\nFirst of all, the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners. With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile. At a higher level, it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand. This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels.\nSecondly, the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection. Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos. What is more, the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species. Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory.\nIn sum, the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable. It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency.",

                "text": "Have you ever seen a bear or a monkey in real life? If you have, it was likely at a zoo. Zoos are expansive outdoor spaces where various animal species are housed so that people can observe, learn about, and appreciate them. Many individuals believe that zoos serve no purpose or are of little value. I strongly disagree with this assertion because I believe zoos offer social interaction, educational opportunities, and foster respect and understanding for animals.\n\nWhen people visit the zoo, they typically do so in groups, with family members, or as part of a school trip. At the zoo, visitors can engage with one another while relaxing, observing the animals, playing with some, commenting on their appearance and behavior, and laughing at their amusing antics. Nowadays, families do not spend as much time together as they did a few decades ago. The zoo provides an excellent opportunity for families to bond; it is an activity that can be enjoyed by everyone, from young children to grandparents.\n\nAnimals, their different species, habitats, and behaviors are studied in schools and universities. While we can learn a great deal from books and lectures, there is an even more effective way to learn: through visual experiences and personal encounters. At the zoo, you have the chance to observe animals, their behaviors, what they eat, and their eating habits, as well as the characteristics that distinguish different species. You can also see male and female animals or observe young ones alongside adults. This presents a valuable opportunity to witness their reactions to various circumstances, including weather changes, species interactions, defensive behaviors, or parental protection. Additionally, it helps in identifying which animals might be dangerous. Thus, visiting the zoo enhances students' understanding of what they learn in school.\n\nFinally, a trip to the zoo fosters respect and appreciation for animals. It is much easier to appreciate something after seeing it in person and learning about it. This is especially true for city dwellers, who often only interact with pets like cats and dogs. Currently, there is a noticeable lack of respect for animals. Observing animals in real life and learning facts about them can raise awareness of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve.\n\nThe primary reason many people oppose zoos is that some do not provide proper care for the animals or maintain clean facilities. While this issue is indeed valid, it does not detract from the fundamental purpose of zoos. It would be ideal for every zoo to maintain perfect conditions for their animals, yet irrespective of their current state, zoos remain valuable institutions.",

Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.\nSome people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.\nOn the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.\nThere are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes. It would mean another industrial revolution.\nTo put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.",

While some individuals believe that adopting a simple way of life, without relying on technological advancements, can solve these problems, others argue that technology is the only solution. In the following paragraphs, I intend to examine both perspectives.\n\nSome people argue that abandoning technology and embracing a simpler lifestyle is the key to saving the environment. They contend that the luxuries provided by technology, such as air conditioners and automobiles, are the primary causes of environmental damage. By refraining from using these technologies, they claim that pollution would decrease, and natural resources like fossil fuels would be preserved, ultimately saving the environment.\n\nOn the other hand, there are those who believe that technology alone can solve environmental problems. They argue that, having progressed so far in technological advancements, it is impractical to expect people to revert to outdated ways of life. It is unrealistic to ask individuals who are accustomed to the convenience of modern technology to abandon it and adopt a more primitive lifestyle.\n\nSignificant technological advancements are being made to address environmental issues. For instance, innovative solutions are being developed to address water scarcity in developing countries, such as Africa. By harnessing the power of seawater, using techniques like pressurizing seawater to produce vapor jets and filtering them through carbon nanotubes, clean drinking water can be produced from this virtually inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working towards establishing a functional space solar power system by 2030. By tapping into the vast energy of the sun, this system could potentially meet the world's entire electricity requirements indefinitely, without emitting nuclear or greenhouse gases. If successful, the impact on the world would be profound, providing energy for essential institutions like schools, hospitals, and homes, and potentially sparking another industrial revolution.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are on the cusp of an era where engineering and technology are poised to make the world a better place. It would be highly impractical to expect people to adopt a simpler way of life, and instead, we should focus on harnessing the power of technology to create a more sustainable future.",

Besides, learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation. Consequently, I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course. I will give reasons to support my opinion.\nTo begin with, learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt. Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example. For example, in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits. Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog. Unlike classroom, online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation.\nSecondly, online class could not provide knowledge about social skills. For instance, In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group. This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group. This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes.\nLastly, learning in classroom, student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body. Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way. If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves. This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide. \nIn conclusion, I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class. Because, classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject. Besides, classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill. Moreover, classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health. Thus, having classroom could provide abundant skills to students.",

One question I have often contemplated is whether online computer classes should replace traditional classroom learning. Although online classes offer many advantages, I personally prefer traditional learning for several reasons.\n\nFirst, interaction with classmates and professors is a crucial factor in the learning process. Working in groups leads to more discussions and diverse opinions within the class. Consequently, these classroom discussions expand students' perspectives and foster respect for their peers' ideas. In contrast, distance learning provides fewer opportunities for children to engage in discussions with their friends.\n\nSecond, classroom learning offers various activities beyond just studying. During their free time, students can participate in numerous activities, such as playing sports, going to labs, or visiting the library. These activities encourage interaction with peers, which enhances their social skills and IQ. Additionally, they provide opportunities to learn about their communities. In contrast, online courses often confine students to their homes.\n\nLastly, in a school setting, professors are available to guide students when they encounter problems or need advice. Professors provide valuable insights and are willing to help, ensuring that students do not feel lost when facing challenges. In distance learning, however, the role of the professor is diminished. They are primarily assigned to teach, and responses to students' questions may take a long time, which can be frustrating.\n\nIn conclusion, traditional learning still offers many benefits to students. However, it seems that distance learning will become more popular and commonplace in schools in the future.",

People can receive a sense of values and respected from job. If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence. In addition, job can provide money to us. \nHowever, people should concern more about their living environment than job. First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives. Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years.

These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work. \nSecond, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people. Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety. Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly.

                "text": "Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.\nEveryone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.\nIn addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.\nLast but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. \nOn the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time. Additionally, honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can't be missing for a persuasive expression.",

Today, communication heavily relies on technology, whether it be through voicemail, email, telephone, or the traditional face-to-face interaction. Personally, I prefer email for three main reasons: convenience, honest expression, and fluency in communication.\n\nIt is widely acknowledged that email is an excellent communication tool. You can connect with others from thousands of miles away. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and someone else is in the U.S. \u2014 literally on the opposite side of the Earth \u2014 you can stay in touch effortlessly. We no longer need to worry about whether our messages will reach the intended recipient; if the address is incorrect, we will know immediately. Moreover, sending an email is quick and easy \u2014 just a click away.\n\nAdditionally, writing emails allows for honest expression. Some individuals feel self-conscious during face-to-face conversations and may struggle to articulate their thoughts as clearly as they would like. For example, if I want to discuss a sensitive issue regarding my friend's behavior, it can be challenging to confront her directly. In such cases, email serves as an effective tool, enabling me to convey my thoughts clearly and without the emotional pressure of a live conversation. She can read my email at her own pace, minimizing the chance of annoyance or misunderstanding.\n\nLastly, effective communication requires fluency so that parties can understand each other clearly and retain the information. Voice messages or face-to-face discussions can sometimes leave reserved individuals feeling unconfident. For instance, when speaking with my parents, I find it difficult to articulate my thoughts coherently. They might interrupt or counter my points, which often leads me to forget what I intended to say. This is a common issue in many conversations. Email allows me the time to organize my ideas thoughtfully, ensuring that my message is both coherent and persuasive.\n\nIn conclusion, when compared to other communication methods, I strongly believe that email is the most effective option for many people. Its convenience saves us time, while honest expression and fluency are essential for impactful communication.",

Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.\nFirstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.\nIn addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.\nFinally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.\nIn conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.",

Therefore to demonstrate that sugar brought about a social revolution in addition to an agricultural revolution, this essay will focus on the islands of Jamaica and Barbados from around the years 1630 to 1690. This is because by 1700, both Jamaica and Barbados became significant producers of sugar. Moreover, the English had found few traces of precious metals in the parts of America which they initially colonized. This meant that the islands (or inland settlements) that they did set up tended to be far more focused around agricultural activities. By the mid 1600s England was in possession of both Jamaica and Barbados. As a result, sugar would become the defining feature of the islands; shaping their future and acting as a precedent for the development of other Caribbean islands in later years. In order to show that society and agriculture in the Caribbean experienced change after the introduction of sugar into its economy, it is useful to make a brief summary of the condition of both areas before continuing. Jamaica was originally a Spanish colony before the English seized it in 1655 and gained formal possession in 1670 through the Treaty of Madrid. Barbados was initially settled in 1627 by the English so remained a British colony until its independence. Spain didn't truly realize the potential economic wealth that could be generated from producing and harvesting the sugar cane in large quantities until after silver and gold mines began to dry up in South America. By then the Spanish had lost some of their territories in the Caribbean to other powers vying for control in the area.

The existence of massive difference in the standard of living all over the world made economists to find the causation of lower living standard in poor countries and the possible ways of helping them to grow faster and catch up with rich ones. The neoclassical theory of economic growth was developed in 1956 by Robert M. Solow, hence, also known as the Solow growth model. It presents the Harrod-Domar model, but adding labour as a factor of production. Solow argued that a key determinant of people's standard of living is how much a nation saves and invests. However, capital accumulation alone cannot explain the persistent growth in living standards. The model assigns continues long-run growth to technological progress, but leaves unexplained the economic determinant of that technological progress. It is simply assumed. Saving, technological progress and growth of population affect the level of output and growth of an economy over time. The basic model assumes that there is no technological progress and that the labour force is fixed: Y = F (K, L), where Y is output, K is capital and L is labour force. The real economy, however, experiences both population growth and technological progress. Express the function in per capita terms: Y/L = F (K/L, 1), the new production function will finally take form of: y = f (k), where output and capital are measured in per head terms (Fig.1). The slope of this function equals the Marginal Product of Capital (MPK) which shows how much extra output a worker produces when given an extra unit of capital. Despite of positive correlation, the function still experiences constant returns to scale.",

The significant differences in standard of living worldwide have prompted economists to investigate the causes of lower living standards in poor countries and explore ways to help them grow faster and catch up with richer nations. The neoclassical theory of economic growth, also known as the Solow growth model, was developed by Robert M. Solow in 1956, building upon the Harrod-Domar model by adding labor as a factor of production. Solow argued that a key determinant of people's standard of living is the amount a nation saves and invests. However, capital accumulation alone cannot explain the persistent growth in living standards. The model attributes continuous long-run growth to technological progress, but does not explain the economic determinants of that technological progress, instead assuming it. Savings, technological progress, and population growth affect the level of output and economic growth over time. The basic model assumes no technological progress and a fixed labor force, expressed as Y = F(K, L), where Y is output, K is capital, and L is the labor force. In reality, economies experience both population growth and technological progress. Expressing the function in per capita terms yields Y/L = F(K/L, 1), and the new production function takes the form of y = f(k), where output and capital are measured per head. The slope of this function equals the Marginal Product of Capital (MPK), indicating how much extra output a worker produces when given an extra unit of capital.

There are many ways in which it can be shown that children aren't taught language whereas they are reading and writing. Children are supplied with both informal and formal tuition in the reading and writing systems. By the time children reach school age they are likely to have received some form of informal teaching of reading and writing from parents which as Crystal notes, is often in the form of a colourful alphabet book bought for the child by relatives. Whatever the source though, the point is; even by the time the child reaches school age they have received some form of teaching regarding reading and writing. At school this obviously increases to formal teaching and schools are legally required to teach children reading and writing. There can be no doubt therefore that children are taught to read and write - it is a simple fact. We can now turn to look then at whether children are taught to speak. The answer is no, at least not in any formal way. By the time children start to attend school they are expected to be able to speak showing that children have learnt to speak without formal teaching. It has been argued that children learn to speak through imitating adults, which could be considered a form of indirect teaching. However the existence of virtuous errors where children produce utterances they couldn't have heard have disproved this idea. Chomsky's idea of innateness and that children have a Language Acquisition Device and are as such are \"genetically 'prewired' to acquire language\" lends credence to the idea that children aren't taught language but instead acquire it naturally. One example that also helps support the idea is that of the silent kids of Nicaragua.",

Children are considered inhabitants of a world inundated by mass media (Brown and Witherspoon, 2002). A controversial issue is when the content of the viewed material contains violence and aggression. The frequency of this content in television programmes and in films was quantified concisely by Browne and Hamilton-Giachritsis (2005). Results from the UNESCO Global Television Violence study show that 61% of programmes investigated contained violence, 55% of which portrayed violence in a realistic setting. They also report that in 71% of these instances, characters showed no remorse for their actions and received no criticism for them. 42% of aggressive acts reported were associated with humour. Over 1000 violent murders, rapes and assaults are shown on television each year (Brown and Witherspoon, 2002). These statistics are worrisome when viewed in light of two theoretical approaches. The first is Bandura's social learning theory, which has given impetus to the television violence debate. Bandura hypothesised that behaviour can be learned through observation, particularly when the behaviour is aggressive. He believed the child's attention to be specifically captured by the violent act, leading them to retain it for the future and to conclude that this aggressive behaviour is acceptable, based largely on whether or not the character is punished. (Bandura, 1973). Viewed in this light, the statistic that characters receive no criticism for their actions 71% of the time becomes dangerous. The concept of learning aggression by observation holds important and worrying implications for this debate, as it suggests that children have the potential to imitate anything they see on television. The second theory is the principle of operant conditioning first investigated by Thorndike (1911). Operant conditioning suggests that positive and negative reinforcements following behaviour will accordingly increase or diminish the chance of a behaviour being performed again.",

                "text": "The nature of human reasoning is a popular area of research in psychology. Its popularity has derived from questions about the rationality of human thought. Rational thought is sometimes defined as thought which is analogous to the laws of logic, where there is always a correct or incorrect answer to a problem and a finite approach to solving it (Eysenck & Keane, 2000). Many psychologists would disagree with this definition because they believe that reasoning does not have to be logical to be rational (Sloman, 1996, Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996 and Chater, Oaksford, Nakisa & Redington, 2003). Sloman (1996) focused, in depth, on the debate over rationality in human reasoning, and created a model involving two systems of reasoning to explain the variety of results found in experiments that investigated reasoning. The two systems of reasoning proposed by Sloman (1996) are an associative system and a rule-based system. These two systems differ in their computations and, when one system is favoured over the other, the way a problem is approached. In the associative system, reasoning takes the form of detecting similarities between situations and events. Associations formed in the past can be drawn upon to solve a particular problem. The associative system does not involve the use of logic but does involve the use of general rules that a person has derived from experience. In the rule-based system, the rules are more specific and have a logical structure. Rules in the rule-based system can be represented in the form of symbols and problems are solved by direct application of these rules. To illustrate the difference between the two systems, Sloman (1996) uses the example of working out the amount of change to give to a customer in a shop.",

Notably, this system does not rely on logic but rather on general rules derived from experience. In contrast, the rule-based system employs more specific rules with a logical structure, which can be symbolically represented and applied directly to solve problems.
